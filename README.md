# AISuite QuickStart Application
Welcome to the AISuite QuickStart Sample application repository! This repository contains samples **(Java and Kotlin)** and resources to help you quickly get started with Zebra Technologies [Mobile Computing AI Suite](https://www.zebra.com/ap/en/software/mobile-computer-software/zebra-mobile-computing-ai-suite.html).

The AISuite Quick Start Sample Application provides a streamlined setup and examples to enable developers to integrate Zebra’s AI capabilities into their applications with ease.

## Introduction
The AI Suite Quick Start repository provides sample code to use various features of AI Data Capture SDK.

* Quickly understand the core features offerred by Zebra’s Mobile Computing AI Suite - The AI Models and the AI Data Capture SDK to use them.
* Set up and run AI-based solutions in a minimal timeframe.
* Access ready-to-use examples for integration into the projects.
* This guide focuses on the contents of the AISuite_QuickStart folder, which is specifically designed to simplify the onboarding process for developers.

Developers can use the [sample shelf image](app/src/main/assets/demo_shelf.jpg) to check how the products are recognized.
